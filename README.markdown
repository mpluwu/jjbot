***This is a Discord bot, for my OC. :man_dancing:***

## 💸General

## 💸All functionalities
- Can greet any member
- Check if your currency is available to convert
- Convert from one currency to another
- React to some keywords (which is based on his lore)
>Keep in mind that this is still a work in progress!!!
## 💸More info
